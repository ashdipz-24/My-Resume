    <h1>My Resume</h1>
    <h2>A brief summary on me:</h2>
    <img src="./pic of me.JPEG" height="200" alt="A picture of me" />
    <p>
      So hello, my name is Ashley Ike, and I'm currently a final-year student in
      the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Lagos, as of the time
      I'm writing this. <br />
      For as long as I can remember, I've had a keen interest in programming,
      but most I've often found myself giving up along the way. So, what makes
      this attempt different, you might wonder? While I can't exactly pin-point
      a reason, but what I do know is that the stakes are a lot higher this
      time, and failure is simply not an option. <br />

      I'm currently enrolled in Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy, and
      it's been quite an exciting journey so far. This resume is part of my
      Capstone Project, a testament to my commitment. So, join me on this
      adventure as I strive to become a great programmer!
